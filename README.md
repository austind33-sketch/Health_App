# Overview

As a software engineer, my goal with this project is to create a functional, user-friendly health and fitness tracking app that allows users to log workouts, track meals, and manage their progress. By working on this app, I aim to further my understanding of Android development, user interface design using Jetpack Compose, and integrating location and data storage features.

The app allows users to:
- Track meals by inputting them into a meal tracker and saving them locally.
- Log workouts with an easy-to-use interface.
- Navigate between different sections of the app with smooth transitions.

The purpose of creating this app is to practice my skills in mobile development and to develop a deeper understanding of how to create apps that interact with local storage and external services such as location tracking. It serves as a comprehensive project for applying Android development techniques learned throughout my learning journey.
